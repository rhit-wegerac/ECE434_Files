<u>**Andrew Weger's Etch-a-Sketch program**</u>

The program first asks for the size of the grid that you want to use, and then repeats back the grid size. Next, the program will prompt for a starting location on the grid. After that, the game creates the board and displays it in the terminal. The row and column numbers are shown in the terminal, and a spot that has not been "drawn" on will be a '.' (I used this instad of a blank space because the space threw off the alignment of the grid), and a "drawn space" will be an 'x'. The player uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the pen around the grid. When the player wants to erase the grid and start over, they can press the space bar, and the board will clear and leave a single 'x' where the pen is. 



When running the program, make sure you are running Python version 3 or newer, the beagle has 2.7 and 3.7 installed and defaults to 2.7. When you run the install.sh program, the final instruction brings up the table of python versions installed on the beagle, just follow the prompt and choose a version that is 3 or newer. 



 To run the program, run the install.sh script. Then, type ./hw01.py into the terminal and the program should run.
